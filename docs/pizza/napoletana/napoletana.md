??? tip "Temperature Control"

    To give yourself more room to manoeuvre, use cool water or substitute some parts of the water with ice cubes.

### Polishing the surface

Before putting the dough to rest, we must ensure a closed surface.

### Grinding the orb

The cut needs to be smoothed out as well.
Therefor we put the orb in hour palm and roll it with the cut facing the surface in a wiggling motion.

### Roll out the Dough

???+ warning "Rolling Pin Method"

    Be careful while rolling out the dough, since applying too much pressure will destroy the air bubbles we have introduces with the yeast.
