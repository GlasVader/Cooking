??? info "Consistency above Recipey"

    You cannot weigh perfectly.
    Even if you could, there are many more variables that go into making the dough.
    Therefore, once you have some experience, you should know how you want your dough to feel.
    Do not follow the recipe too closely, but trust what you know will make a good Pizza.

??? tip "Temperature Control"

    To give yourself more room to manoeuvre, especially during a hot summer, use cooled water or substitute some parts of the water with ice cubes.
    With this method, you should use the weight instead of the volume, since 1 kg of ice cubes is equal to 1 kg of water.

### Polishing the surface

Before putting the dough to rest, we must ensure a closed surface.

### Grinding the orb

The cut needs to be smoothed out as well.
Therefor we put the orb in hour palm and roll it with the cut facing the surface in a wiggling motion.

### Roll out the Dough

??? warning "Rolling Pin Method"

    Be careful while rolling out the dough, since applying too much pressure will destroy the air bubbles we have introduces with the yeast.

Start by "massaging" the orb in the center.
Use the fingertips of both hands for that.
From there, begin to stretch out the dough a little.
Do not use too much force, if you feel more resistance, rotate the dough a bit and stretch another part.
Continue until you have a "plate" about the size of your palm.

??? info "Do not smush the edge"

    As with the rolling pin, massaging the future crust will prevent it from becoming fluffy.
    Try working from the center instead.

??? tip "Do not stress the gluten"

    Because gluten forms a network, too much force will tear it apart.
    Give the dough a little time to adjust to its new shape after initial rolling.

## Sauce

The original sauce does not need much.
The golden rule of KISS <i><b>K</b>eep <b>I</b>t <b>S</b>imple (<b>S</b>tupid)</i> applies here as well.

    === "for 25 cm"

        Stop and make a proper sized Pizza.

    === "for 30 cm"

        * 110 gr tomato pulp
        * a pinch of salt
        * some Oregano

    === "for 35 cm"

        * 170 gr tomato pulp
        * a pinch of salt
        * some Oregano

-   __Procedure__

    ---
    <ol>
    <li>If you use tomatoes, turn them into a pulp.</li>
    <li>Add the salt to the pulp.</li>
    <li>Add the Oregano to the salted pulp.</li>
    </ol>
    </br>Some like to add olive oil, I prefer to leave out the salt, for the dough and the topping should provide enough.
    In some recipes the Oregano is left out.
    Experiment and find what suits you best.
