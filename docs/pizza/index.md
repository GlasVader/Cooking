-  __Napoletana__

    ---

    The OG of Pizza. The Napoletana is characterised by her thick & fluffy crust, the thin centre and simple toppings.

-   __Romana__

    ---
    In contrast to the Napoletana, the Romana is for those who like their pizza thin and crispy.

-   __New York Style__

    ---
    The crust in the New York Style is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat.
